## Winter 2020: Experimental design for CO2 x heatwave effects in Pacifc herring early life-satges


Experiments were conducted at Shannon Point Marine Center in Anacortes, WA. Embryos and larvae were reared in 16 independent flow-through units composed of a 40 L elevated header tank and a 15 L rearing container situated below the header tank. Embryos were reared in customzied 1 L polyethelene baskets fitted 300-um flow-through mesh that were floated in the rearing containers. CO2 was bubbled into half of the header tanks to achieve a treatment pCO2 level of ~ 2500 uatm while CO2-stripped air was bubbled into control pCO2 tanks to maintain ~500 uatm.
