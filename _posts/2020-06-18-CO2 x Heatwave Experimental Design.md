## Winter 2020: Experimental design for CO2 x heatwave effects in Pacifc herring early life-satges


Experiments were conducted at Shannon Point Marine Center in Anacortes, WA. Embryos and larvae were reared in 16 independent flow-through units composed of a 40 L elevated header tank and a 15-L rearing container situated below the header tank. Embryos were reared in customized 1-L polyethylene baskets fitted 300-um flow-through mesh that were floated in the rearing containers. CO2 was bubbled into half of the header tanks to achieve a treatment pCO2 level of ~ 2500 uatm while CO2-stripped air was bubbled into control pCO2 tanks to maintain ~500 uatm.

On Feb 19 gonads were dissected from 12 wild adult herring (9 females and 3 males) collected by Washington's DFW (thanks Jim West!). Gonads were stored in glass dishes covered with moist paper towels and stored at 4.5°C for 48h.  Fertilization commenced on Feb 21 following protocols established by [Dinnel et al 2010](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00244-010-9600-8). Four large plastic dishes (one per treatment) were filled with 750 ml filtered and autoclaved seawater (salinity 32) and were lined with 300-um nylon mesh screening. Fertilization took place at 8.5°C in a temperature controlled room. Ovary membranes were gently slcied opened, and by using a small silicone spatula I scooped few eggs at a time and and used a sweeping motion to deposit them into one of the spawning dishes such the the eggs were evenly spread and adhered to the submerged nylon screens. Eggs from each female were randomly distrubted to each spawning trey until the screens were largely covered with a single layer of eggs.
