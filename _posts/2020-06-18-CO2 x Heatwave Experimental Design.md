## Winter 2020: Experimental design for CO2 x heatwave effects in Pacifc herring early life-satges


Experiments were conducted at Shannon Point Marine Center in Anacortes, WA. Embryos and larvae were reared in 16 independent flow-through units composed of a 40 L elevated header tank and a 15-L rearing container situated below the header tank. Embryos were reared in customized 1-L polyethylene baskets fitted 300-um flow-through mesh that were floated in the rearing containers.

I employed a 2 x 2 CO2 x temperature experimental design (N = 4 replicate tanks per treatment level). Two pCO2 conditions were achieved (~500 and ~2500 uatm). The high CO2 level was achieved by bubbling 99% CO2 into half of the header tanks. CO2-stripped air was bubbled into control pCO2 tanks to maintain ~500 uatm. CO2 treatments were split into two temperature regimes: ambient and heatwave. Initially all tanks were maintained at ambient temperatures until 5 days post-fertilization when a heatwave was initiated in half of the tanks per CO2 treatment. 

## Fertilization

On Feb 19 gonads were dissected from 12 wild adult herring (9 females and 3 males) collected by Washington's DFW (thanks Jim West!) On Feb 19 gonads were dissected from 12 wild adult herring (9 females and 3 males) collected by Washington's DFW (thanks Jim West!). Gonads were stored in glass dishes covered with moist paper towels and stored at 4.5°C for 48h.  Fertilization commenced on Feb 21 following protocols established by [Dinnel et al 2010](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00244-010-9600-8). Four large plastic dishes (one per treatment) were filled with 750 ml filtered and autoclaved seawater (salinity 32) and were lined with 300-um nylon mesh screening. Fertilization took place at 8.5°C in a temperature-controlled room. Five 1-cm2 square sections were sampled from each male teste were eviscerated together on 300-µm screen and the milt was filtered into a 1-L glass beaker filled with clean seawater. Then, 250-ml of milt-seawater was poured and gently mixed into each spawning dish. Next, ovary membranes were gently sliced opened, and I used a small silicon spatula to scoop a few eggs at a time and deposited them into the spawning dishes by with a quick sweeping motion through the water. Eggs from each female were randomly distributed to each spawning tray until the screens were largely covered with a single layer of eggs. Eggs and milt were left so soak for 1 hr.

Screen were then rinsed with clean seawater to remove milt and unattached eggs then were soaked in a 100-ppm solution of Povadine in seawater for disinfection. Screens were than cut into smaller sections and distributed to one of four replicate tanks per treatment level.
