I sent 16 larvae (one per replicare tank) to UW's Functional Genomics Core for a pilot RNA extraction and QC. The extraction was completed by Dr. Sengkeo Srinouanprachanh.

RNA extracted using Zymo RNA Mini Kit. QC done using Eukaryote Total RNA Pico in Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer. 

RNA quality varied between samples. See the electropherograms below:


**Replicates 1-8**

**Replicates 9-16**

A conservative cutoff for RIN is ~7, although samples with slightly lowers RINs could be accounted for during analysis. We that that 10/16 samples had RIN > 7, 3 samples > 6, and 3 samples < 6. 

## Next  Steps
I have ~15 more samples per replicate tank preserved in RNAlater. Based on the images I took of the original larvae used for this pilot, evidence for visual degradation is a reltively good marker for RNA quality. Thus, I should be able to pick out a few winners from each replicate vial for quality analysis.
