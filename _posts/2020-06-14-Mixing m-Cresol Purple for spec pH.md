## **m-Cresol Purple**

Mixed 9 mg m-Cresol purple (Lot# MKBR3556V) with 10 ml RO water.

The first test on the spec showed a raw absorbance ratio (578nm/434nm) was ~2.

The pH of presevred experimental seawater samples ranges between 8.0-7.3 (pHT) and dye ratio should be closer to 1. 

Added two drops (~100 ul) of 0.1N HCl and ratio dropped to 0.95.

The dye was verified by calculating TA of Dickson CRM via spec pH and DIC measurements.
