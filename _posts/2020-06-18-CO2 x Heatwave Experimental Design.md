## **Winter 2020: Experimental design for CO2 x heatwave effects in Pacifc herrinf early life-satges **


Experiments were conducted at Shannon Point Marine Center in Anacortes, WA. Embryos and larvae were reared in 16 independent 
flow-through units composed of a 40 L elevated header tank and a 15 L rearing container situated below the header tank. 
Header tanks received a continuous supply of filtered (to 5 µm) seawater drawn from Guemes Channel, Puget Sound (48°30'34.5"N 122°41'04.5"W).
