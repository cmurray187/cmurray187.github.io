I sent 16 larvae (one per replicare tank) to UW's Functional Genomics Core for a pilot RNA extraction and QC. The extraction was completed by Dr. Sengkeo Srinouanprachanh.

RNA extracted using Zymo RNA Mini Kit. QC done using Eukaryote Total RNA Pico in Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer. 

RNA quality varied between samples. See the electropherograms below:
