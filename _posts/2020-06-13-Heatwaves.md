## **Marine Heatwaves in the PNW**

Marine heatwaves are increasing in severity and frequency and pose a serious threat to marine life. Experimental exposures that test physiological tolerance limits can identify vulnerable taxa, but useful experiments require a robust characterization of regional heatwave dynamics. In advance of my 2020 winter experiments on Pacific herring early life-stages, I analyzed an 18 year NEERS dataset (https://coast.noaa.gov/nerrs/reserves/padilla-bay.html) from [Padilla Bay, WA](https://coast.noaa.gov/nerrs/reserves/padilla-bay.html). The monitoring station was situated within a large sea grass system and representative of typical herring spawning habitat.  



Here's a useless table:

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.
